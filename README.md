# Schedule Tracker (RS 69)

A random late-night project that started with a failed attempt to connect directly to Google Calendar via API. After realizing verification could take weeks, I switched to using an `.ics` file instead â€” much faster and easier!

## What is it?

A simple tool that generates your RS 69 class schedule and exports it as an `.ics` file that you can import into any calendar app (Google, Outlook, Apple, etc.). No data collection, just generate and download your schedule.

## How to Use

1. Enter your section number.
2. View your generated schedule.
3. Download the `.ics` file.
4. Import the downloaded file into your preferred calendar app.
